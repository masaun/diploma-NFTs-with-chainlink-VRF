# Diploma-NFTs with Chainlink-VRF
## 【Overview】
- This is a smart contract that give graduates a diploma of schools (such as college, university, etc) which is published as a `NFT` with a `random number (randomness)` generated by `Chainlink-VRF (Verifiable Random Function) ` 

<br>

- By using that, 
  - Schools (such as college, university, etc) can give graduates truly unique diploma.
  - Graduates can utilize their diploma as a proof for various opportunities.
